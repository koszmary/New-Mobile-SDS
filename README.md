# New-Mobile-SDS
I’ve been working on my project, but unfortunately, for a while I wasn’t committing as often as I should have. When I finally tried to commit all my changes, I encountered an error saying that the changes were too large. After several attempts, I managed to commit them by force, but now I’m unable to push the changes. I keep getting an error—push reaches 99% and then fails. I tried everything I know to fix it, but nothing worked, and the repo contains many commits that I can not push.

Because of this, I created a new repository where I uploaded .zip files from Android Studio containing all my project materials, video files, and the Learning Diary. In the README file, I’ve also added a link to the old (now outdated) repository, where at least you can see the beginning of my work and links to YouTube videos.

Everything should work properly (at least it does on my end), but if I forgot to include anything important in the new repository, or if any files are not working and that would result in the project not being accepted, please let me know.
